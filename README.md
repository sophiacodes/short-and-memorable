# Short and memorable. Word. 
![alt text](https://github.com/sophiacodes/short-and-memorable/blob/master/client/src/assets/images/app-screenshot.png)

## The initial setup:
```bash
npm i
```
```bash
cd client && npm i && cd ..
```

## Running the app:
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Running the tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Suggested improvements/todos:
* Create high order component for the pages to pass global state variables.
* Use a css preprocessor for styles... or perhaps even JS CSS instead. 
* Re-work some of the core components.
* Achieve 100% test coverage.
